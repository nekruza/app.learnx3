        Curitiba in Brazil is no ordinary city; it has the best public transport system in the world. The mayor, Jaime Lerner, along with the council, began developing the world-famous system in 1971.
        Mr Lerner had grown up in Curitiba and knew that the street was an important part of city life for the residents. He made many of the streets into pedestrian areas, with no access for cars. The council put in flowers, lights, and kiosks where people could sell food and other products. To encourage shoppers to use the new areas, the mayor gave away free paper so that local children could paint pictures in the street. Cyclists also benefit from 150km of cycle lanes, which follow old river valleys and railway tracks around the city.
        Mr Lerner realized that to increase the development and growth of the city in the future, the public transport system also had to improve. Buses were chosen as the main transport because it was the cheapest. Curitiba’s transport system now consists of over 300 routes that use around 1,900 buses to carry approximately 1.9 million passengers every day. Approximately 60km of the roads are for buses only, so traffic jams are unusual. Bus travel is faster and more convenient than using private cars. The city now uses 30% less fuel than other large cities in Brazil and people spend only about 10% of their yearly salaries on transport costs.
        Some of the buses are able to carry 170–270 passengers. School buses are yellow, and buses for disabled people are blue. They are designed with three doors – two exits and one entrance – so that people can get on and off quickly. Bus stations provide free maps and facilities to help parents with young children and people carrying heavy bags to board the buses easily. Passengers buy a ticket at the office in advance and then wait for their bus, like in an underground station.
        Because of the success of Curitiba’s public transport system, Jaime Lerner now offers advice to city councils around the world on how they can solve their cities’ transport problems.

	*Maria Stanovich*
	I’ve always had a strong relationship with my family. An important influence on my personality was my grandmother, Hannah. She was born in 1930 into a poor family with seven children – they had to take very good care of each other in order to survive. Growing up in such difficult conditions had a positive effect on her, teaching her to share everything, be honest, helpful, hard-working, and affectionate. My grandmother taught me all these things, making me realize that family is more important than material possessions.
	
	*Katie Dupont*
	The people around you have the greatest influence on your life – they affect the way you behave and think. As soon as Rob and I met, we connected. When Rob was young, his father died in a motorcycle accident. Being brought up as an only child by a single parent made him independent and ambitious. He left home at 16, and since then has lived in different places and had various jobs. He’s taught me that it’s important to find time for friends and family and to do what makes you happy. He always has fun, trying new things, keeping his mind and body healthy, and he still works hard to achieve his goals. I greatly admire Rob and I hope that one day I can look at life in the way that he does.   

	*Jed Mitchell*
	I spent many hours as a child listening to my uncle Wilson’s stories. He was the youngest of 11 children whose family lived in a fishing town in Scotland. Life was hard and with so many mouths to feed, the children began working from an early age. At just 14, my uncle began his first job as a fisherman. That was the beginning of his adventures – he traveled and worked in Alaska, South-East Asia, India, and Africa. He educated himself, learnt to be a chef, an engineer, a farmer, and photographer. Uncle Wilson taught me that life is special and that you should take every opportunity that you can to fill it with adventure.

	text: `New York City is no ordinary city; it has a hero like no other - Spider-Man. This web-slinging superhero has been swinging through the streets of the Big Apple since 1962, protecting its citizens from various threats and villains. Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, grew up in New York City and understood the importance of safety and justice for its residents. 
  
  Inspired by his own experiences, Peter decided to use his extraordinary powers to make a difference in the city that never sleeps. He swings from skyscrapers, jumps from rooftops, and races through the bustling streets, ensuring that the innocent are protected and the wrongdoers are brought to justice. The citizens of New York City greatly appreciate Spider-Man's presence. His agile movements and quick thinking have saved countless lives and prevented major disasters. People feel safer knowing that Spider-Man is watching over them. In addition to his crime-fighting abilities, Spider-Man has also contributed to the development and improvement of the city. He has worked with local authorities to create safer neighborhoods and implement initiatives to support the less fortunate. Whether it's helping with community outreach programs or rebuilding areas affected by crime, Spider-Man is always there to lend a helping hand. Spider-Man's mode of transportation is as impressive as his heroics. He swings across the city using his web-shooters, effortlessly navigating through traffic and avoiding congestion. This unique method allows him to reach any part of the city in record time, ensuring that he can respond to emergencies promptly. The citizens of New York City have come to rely on Spider-Man as their protector and symbol of hope. His dedication to the city and its people has earned him the admiration and respect of everyone. People often gather in Times Square, Central Park, and other iconic locations, hoping to catch a glimpse of their favorite superhero in action. Spider-Man's popularity extends beyond New York City. His heroic deeds have inspired people around the world, and he has become an icon of courage and selflessness. Many cities look to Spider-Man as a role model for their own local heroes, seeking advice on how to combat crime and create a safer environment for their residents. Spider-Man's presence in New York City is a testament to the power of one individual to make a difference. His actions remind us that anyone, regardless of their background, can become a hero and change the world.`,
